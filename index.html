								<h3>WHY GAPJUMPER?</h3>
								<p> Nelson Madela once said, "Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."
								We wanted to create this game to educate people about the Wage Gap for women. In 2012, the median earnings
								of American women working full time year-round was $37,791. American men earned a median income of $49,398.
								The gender wage gap has hovered at about 77 cents on the dollar </p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
								<p>since 2007. Women start of earning less than men even at the age of 16. Why is this happening? The Wage
								Gap for women is still happening because women still aren’t a priority. Women have played a key role in
								economic growth which means there skill and mindset is necessary to development of our societies. Closing the
								gender gap can help create a more equal and better working society. The at-risk-of-poverty rate is around 22%
								for women over 65%, </p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
								<p>compared to 16% of men
								over 65. We need to work together to create equal pay for everyone no matter there race or gender. </p>
